A few tutorials how to install some programs in Centos 7, such as: Apache, Solr, Ejabberd and so on


A lot of times is difficult to find some tutorials to install programs on Centos 7. Usually you might find some for debian or ubuntu. And some time when you find it doesn't have everything you need.

This is a few tutorials that I've made for me based on a lot of incomplete tutorials or even no tutorial at all.
